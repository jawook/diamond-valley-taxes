# Diamond Valley Tax Analysis

Every year there is confusion and concern about the determination and calculation of municipal taxes.  As a result, I wanted to put together a tool that will help people to understand their taxes a little better so that people are better able to understand the calculation and cut through misinformation and "spin".

## Data Sources
All data is sourced from publicly available information.  Currently, the old Turner Valley website publishes historical assessment information going back to 2014.  Additionally, the initial 2023 tax assessment roll (a listing of all property tax assessments in the community) has been posted to the Diamond Valley website.  All pdf files have been downloaded to this github repo for posterity.

I requested spreadsheet versions of these files by [email to the Diamond Valley tax email address] (mailto: tax@diamondvalley.town "Link to send email")
